# Peer Stream - Real Time Video Chat Application

## Description
This real-time video chat application is developed using WebRTC, Socket.io, Node.js, Express.js, and React.js.


## How To Use
1. Enter the room ID and your email to join the room.

2. Share the room ID with the other person and ask them to join the same room.

3. Once both of you are in the room, you will see a "Call" button. Click this button to initiate the video call.

## My Learnings

Through developing this project, I gained insights into the following technologies:

1) WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication):This technology facilitates real-time peer-to-peer communication between web browsers and mobile applications. It provides a straightforward set of APIs for enabling real-time communication over the internet.
2) Socket.IO: Used for real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It includes a Node.js server component and a JavaScript client library for browsers, extending real-time capabilities to web applications.
