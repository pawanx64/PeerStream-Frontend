## My Learnings

Through developing this project, I gained insights into the following technologies:

1) WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication):This technology facilitates real-time peer-to-peer communication between web browsers and mobile applications. It provides a straightforward set of APIs for enabling real-time communication over the internet.
2) Socket.IO: Used for real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It includes a Node.js server component and a JavaScript client library for browsers, extending real-time capabilities to web applications.
